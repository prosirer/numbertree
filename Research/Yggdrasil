YGGDRASIL (Norse aka Trojan)
This is likely a Tree of Death (Tree of Life reversed) due to the first three emanations being "roots" in the ground reaching into three different wells, and these roots extending close to the underworld of Hel. The dragon Nidhoggr (1) and the eagle Hraesvelgr (9) insulting each other is another pointer.
The Three roots of the tree are the first three emanations, archetypes of death:
1. The well Hvergelmir. Over Niflheim. Root is chewed on by the wyrm Nidhoggr, root struggles to maintain strength (will = 1).
    Takes Odin's horse Sleipnir nine days to get there (nine emanations from Yesod).
    Source of life (Kether). Created the first living being.
2. The well Mimisbrunnr. Over the frost jotnar. Mimir's well "which has wisdom and intelligence contained in it."
    Odin drank from the well of wisdom (Chokmah), but sacrificed his RIGHT EYE as payment (Right pillar = male).
3. The well Urdarbrunnr. Three Norns live here (females, 3 = top of female/negative pillar). The personification of time (Binah).
    Collects clay and puts over the tree (creates form by separation).
4. The four harts Dainn, Dvalinn, Duneyrr and Durapror.
5. ???
6. The squirrel Ratatoskr. Lives at the center of the tree (Tiferet). Spreads gossip between source and man, much like what the ego would do. Bears messages between eagle and Nidhoggr.
7. The goat Heidrun. Source of all mead.
8. The stag Eikthyrnir.
9. The eagle Hraesvelgr. His wind covers over the people (likely to "keep them down" or descending the Tree of Death).
↊. Midgard.
