# numbertree
Public repository of a new Kaballic onomancy system

# What is this?
numbertree is a publically available "source code" of a numerological divination system of the same name. It is based upon the Tree of Sefirot as found within the Kaballah while utilizing a dozenal (base 12) counting system to divinate the birthname. Given the esoteric nature of the source material, it is more geared towards those looking for esoteric meaning and the spiritual lessons one has been given within this incarnation. This repo is a collection of documents that describe the divination system, maintained by the originator and other collaborators for those who may be interested in using this system for themselves. 

# What is it not?
This is not a piece of software designed to calculate the system, nor is there any code involved here. 
This is not a divination system based upon "Pythagorean" numerology. The Pythagorean number definitions have been removed and replaced with those found in the Sefirot and related sources. 

# License?
For now, there is no license while this repo & system is being constructed, so users may download the source code, but cannot modify it in anyway as of yet. This is expected to change in the future.
