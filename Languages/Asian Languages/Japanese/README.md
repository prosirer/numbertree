### <span id="anchor-26"></span>Japanese

Japanese personal names are written with kanji, which is a logographic
system. Due to this, personal names are romanized via romaji using the
Modified Hepburn system. Once this is performed, the letters are then
translated into numbers using the English tables, as the Hepburn system
uses English phonology.
