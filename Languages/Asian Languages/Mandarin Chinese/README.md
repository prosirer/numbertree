### <span id="anchor-25"></span>Mandarin Chinese

Chinese is a logosyballic language and as such does not contain letters
but characters. Because of this, Hanyu Pinyin is used to translate the
Chinese characters into English letters. This works for all Chinese
dialects (Yue, Wu, etc). Unfortunately, there are certain sounds in the
Chinese language that do not have an equivalent in the English language.
As a result, a chart in this language may not be as accurate as charts
in other languages. 

The name as spelled using the celestial stems and terrestrial branches
should not be used here – only the Pinyin variant. This is because
Pinyin is the closest alphabetical approximation to the sound of the
birth name as it is spoken. That is not to say that the stems and
branches are wrong, on the contrary. They can provide great insight.
However, the acoustics pronounced are the bigger focal point of this system.

Once the name is translated into Pinyin, the letters that make up the
Pinyin name are then translated into numbers according to the table
below. Then, the numbers can be added together to reach a final sum. 

**Vowels**: A, O, E, I, U, Ǖ.
