Arabic is a modified abjad language as it includes written long vowels
along with tashkil that are used during certain occasions. As such,
Arabic names can be used in their native language to divinate the birth
name. The process is similar to Hisab al-Jummal. 

The name as it appears on the birth certificate must be used and each
letter converted into a number. Regardless if there are harakat written
with the birth name or not, the short vowels must also be added with the
name. Short vowels have the same values as their long vowel
counterparts. If no birth certificate exists, then the name as spoken at
birth must be written down as accurately as possible. 

Along with the harakat, the following are some tashkil that can affect
the calculation of the name:

ـً ـٍ ـٌ  = Tanwin. The word ends in pronouncing a nasal vowel and not
the letter nun. Therefore, nun is not included in the calculation.

ـّـ = Shaddah. If a consonant is doubled, then its numeric value is
added twice in the word.

ـٓ = Maddah. The glottal stop has the same value as alif, but counts as
a consonant.

If the ه is attached to another letter to form a word, all of the formed
letters must be added to the total. For example, if two yaw’s are
formed, then the numerical value of yaw is added twice. This happens in
the following instances:

Ha: ها

Hoo: هو  
Hee: هي

If ة is used to indicate the female gender, then the inherent vowel it
carries is counted instead.

If the hamza (ء) is written in the birthname, then it has the same
numerical value as alif in the charts. However, it must be counted as a
consonant instead of a vowel.

The Arabic letter tables are numbered using Western Arabic numerals.
Using Eastern Arabic numerals is acceptable as long as there are symbols
that represent ↊ and ↋. However, it would be wise to avoid confusion
between ٤ and ↋ (four and eleven). 

The following tables use the common abjadi order of the letters.
