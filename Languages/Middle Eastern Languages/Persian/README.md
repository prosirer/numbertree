### <span id="anchor-78"></span>Persian

Persian is a modified abjad that indicates its vowels, and so this
language can be used natively to divinate the name. 

The harakat must be included in the written name. This will vary
depending on the dialect. While modern Persian uses three vowels, there
are dialects that use as many as six. However, in a general sense, the
extra vowels are typically long or short forms of the same vowel. In
other languages, long and short forms typically have the same numerical
value and that will be the case here. For this reason, the modern
Persian diacritics are to be used, with vowels in other dialects to be
merged into either zebar, zer or pes. 

If the hamza (ء) is written in the birthname, then it has the same
numerical value as alif in the charts. However, it must be counted as a
consonant instead of a vowel.

These charts are numbered using Western Arabic numerals. Using Persian
or Eastern Arabic numerals is acceptable as long as there are symbols
that represent ↊ and ↋. For Eastern Arabic, it would be wise to avoid
confusion between ٤ and ↋ (four and eleven). 

Those born in Iran or Afghanistan will have to use the Solar Hijri
calendar to calculate the Morphic Field. Please see the Calendar.md file in the Persian folder for more
information.
