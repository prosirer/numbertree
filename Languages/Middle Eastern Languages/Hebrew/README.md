### <span id="anchor-79"></span>Hebrew

Hebrew is a modified abjad that indicates its vowels, and so this
language can be used natively to divinate the name. This section covers
only modern Hebrew.

The birthname must be written using ktiv menuqad. This is because the
pronunciation of the name must be marked as closely as possible to
ensure accuracy of the chart. The numerical values of the niqqud are
determined by matres lectionis and placed appropriately in the tables
below. Writing the name through ktiv hasar niqqud is not recommended
because of a lack of unity in writing for many reasons, including
ignorance of grammatical knowledge and unpopular linguistic decisions
from the Vaad ha-lashon. In contrast, ktiv menuqad has well established
and widely known rules.

There is no numerical difference between long and short vowels. This is
equivalent to English which represents both long and short vowels with
one letter. 

Aleph as a letter is counted as a consonant by default, whether used as
a glottal stop or is silent. However, if niqqud with aleph are used,
then it counts as a vowel. 

If the niqqud Sh’va is used to indicate Ø, then it has no numerical
value.

Those born in Israel will use the Gregorian calendar to calculate the
Morphic Field, as this is the calendar used on Israeli birth
certificates.
