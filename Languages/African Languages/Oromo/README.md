### <span id="anchor-59"></span>Oromo

There are several scripts that Oromo can use, including Latin, Ge’ez and
Arabic and this depends upon the dialect spoken and ethnicity of its
speakers. Here, the Qubee system will be used as it is the most popular.

Long vowels have double the value of the initial vowel. For example, in
the Lightning Chart, Aa would have a value of 2 because A is equal to 1.

Vowels that are voiceless (word final) are added to the overall total,
but are added to the Interface core number as a consonant instead of the
Heart core number. 

Those born in Ethiopia or Eritrea will have to use the Ethiopian
calendar to calculate the Morphic Field. Please see the Calendar.md file in this folder for more
information. 

**Vowels**: A, E, I, O, U.
