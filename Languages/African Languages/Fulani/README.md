### <span id="anchor-66"></span>Fulani

Fulani uses a variety of scripts to write the language: Latin, Arabic
and Adlam. While Latin is the most commonly used, each country that has
used it was allowed to develop the language on their own. This has
resulted in Latin scripts with different letters depending on the
country, which would lead to unwieldy number tables. On top of this,
Latin does not fully represent the sounds of the Fulani language, even
with modified letters. 

On the other hand, the Adlam script represents all the sounds of the
language and is quickly spreading throughout the Fulani community. While
not all Fulani speakers know how to write the language in Adlam, it is
the most phonetically representative of the name and in the author’s
wisdom, this is the script that should be used. 

Long vowels have the same value as short vowels. This is the equivalent
of the Latin letters where a vowel letter can represent both its long
and short forms.

The supplemental letters are listed below the main consonants in their
own order.
