### <span id="anchor-73"></span>Malagasy

There are two main dialects of Malagasy: Eastern and Western, both with
numerous offshoot dialects. Both of the main dialects use the same
letters in the same order, so the tables below will work for both
dialects.

Because of the dialects, it is important to write the name as it is
spoken in the birth dialect rather than simply relying on the spelling.
Any new letters spoken in the dialect must be included in the written
name. 

**Vowels**: A, E, I, O.
