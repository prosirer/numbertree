### <span id="anchor-54"></span>Amazigh (Berber)

This language is usually written with the Tifinagh script, which is a
pure abjad and hence cannot be used natively to calculate the name due
to the vowels being inherent and unwritten. However, there are several
options available.

The first option is to use one of the Berber Latin alphabets. This is
the preferred way by the majority of Berbers who wish to see their
language quickly proliferate. Respecting that, this option would be the
better choice in the author’s opinion. 

Another option is to use the recent Neo-Tifinagh script or Tifinagh
Ircam, which is fully alphabetic and includes vowels as full letters.
This script is typically used in Morocco. However, this script does not
account for the many regional variations of the original Tifinaugh and
many do not use it natively. 

The North and South Berber scripts are listed below. Please note that
these tables only serve as a guide. There are many Berber dialects that
include letters while excluding others, and all of them could not be
possibly listed here.
