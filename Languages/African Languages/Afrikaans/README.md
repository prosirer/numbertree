### <span id="anchor-69"></span>Afrikaans

Afrikaans uses the same letters and letter order as English, so those
with Afrikaans birth names can use the English tables in the English folder to divinate the name.

Any vowel diphthongs such as “oo” or “oei” should be treated as
individual letters as to their value.
