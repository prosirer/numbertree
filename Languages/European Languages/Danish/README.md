### <span id="anchor-13"></span>Danish

The Norwegian language is based upon the Dano-Norwegian alphabet, hence
both languages use this alphabet.

The letter W, if found in personal names before 1980 will have the same
value as V in the tables below. All letters after V should have their
values decreased by 1 accordingly. 

The letter Aa, often found in family names, will reflect the number of
the letter Å. This creates varying values depending upon when the
individual was born. If born between 1955 and 1980, the number of Aa
will be the following:

Lightning Chart: 6, Growth Chart: 7, Serpent Chart: 6, Halving Chart: 8.

If born after 1980, the number of Aa will be the same value as the
letter Å in the charts below.

**Vowels**: A, E, I, O, U, Y, Æ, Ø, Å.
