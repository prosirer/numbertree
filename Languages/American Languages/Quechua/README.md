### <span id="anchor-86"></span>Quechua

Those who speak Quechua will often be born with Spanish names as the
Peruvian register for many years did not allow native names to be
listed. This is a point of contention as many would rather be officially
known by their indigenous name. Often, a person will have one name in
Spanish and another name in their Quechua dialect. 

Therefore, determining the language tables to use boils down to how
often a name is spoken. 

If a speaker of Quechua was given a Spanish name at birth and is
primarily known by that name, then that name must be divinated by using
the Spanish tables. Please see the Spanish section of this appendix for
more information.

However, if a Quechua name was given parallel to the one officially
registered, and the Quechua name is the one the person is primarily
known by, then that name is to be used with the Quechua tables in this
section. This includes names that are half Spanish and half Quechua, as
the name would be spoken in Quechua the majority of the time.

Quechua is a highly oral language with most being illiterate, so the
written form does not take precedence. For those interested in
divinating their Quechua birth name, the letters do not have to be
written down. Instead, the sounds of the letters in the birth name can
be translated to their numerical value then added together to reach a
sum. The resulting number will be the spiritual power behind the letters
and foretells the lessons to learn as given by the Creator.

There are many different dialects of Quechua. The ones that total
roughly 1 million or more speakers are planned for this section.
