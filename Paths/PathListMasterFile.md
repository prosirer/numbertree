## 3

### 3-3:

### 3-4: Path of Abundance

### 3-5: Path of the Chariot

This path acts like a vehicle of judgment that resolves outstanding desires that have harmed the self and others. It leads to the purification of the blood (carrier of sin created by selfish desire) through embarassment, hardships, hard work and suffering. During this process, the heart is judged in order to purify it. It is physical action that can purify these issues through helping others.

It rules the creation of power to move the spirit. This creation happens through proper judgment.

### 3-↊: Path of the Hour Glass

### 3-↋:

## 4

### 4-4: Path of Boundaries

### 4-5: Path of Strength

### 4-6: Path of the Open Hand

Also called the Wayshower and the Hermit. Path of reconciliation between the lower and higher selves through isolation. Relying on one's own inner light to move forward.
The intense sexuality with this path is not intended for primal gratification or outer chasing, but to be used in a self-contained manner that can create the inner light needed to sustain themselves (4+6=↊, the number of self-sustainability).

46/64 will create intense interests in sexuality wherever it appears.

Negative: Fears being alone with themselves, worships sexual copulation, sexual parasite, fears not having control over their lives so tries to subtly control others, chases materialism.

### 5-6: Path of the Scales

This path brings justice, spiritual balance and karmic adjustment. Opposing forces are measured and discriminated as to their origins, leading to growth of inner awareness (↋) of one's spirit.
When the scales balance, inner insight is achieved.

### 5-7: Path of the Hawk

Represents the disciplining of endurance and imagination to overcome adversity, allowing the expression of divine will though a person (5+7=10/1). It gives the ability to discern a situation and see the whole picture. If positive, a purging of impractical thoughts that have little to no manifest potential occurs.

This Path can identify and repair addictions.

Those stuck on this path become mired in illusions and fly high only in their minds.

Negative: Traitors, greedy, pie in the sky, lacks discernment, predators of any kind, undisciplined, violent.

### 5-8: Path of the Dying God

Baptism of Water.

This path represents the reversal of ordinary consciousness and the suspension of the normal senses. This creates an openness of personal consciousness where a greater reality is imposed.

This path is called "Dying God" to symbolize the personal consciousness becoming open (without beginning or end) to the eternal consciousness of the source, whereby it "dies" and then becomes reborn again.

### 5-9: Path of the Candle

### 5-↊: Path of Control

### 5-↋:

## 6

### 6-6:

### 6-7: Path of the Seed

Nun = to sprout or to grow. Arcana 13: Death.

### 6-8: Path of the Eye

This path is meant to show that the material condition is not "real" despite what may be seen by the eye. This is where one's perspective of the world is changed. It is recognizing the difference between the sensory world and the one seen by the inner eye.

This path will show the contradicting factors between one's vision of the world and its relationship to their spiritual reality, and how this vision must be rectified to make their spirituality better manifest in the world. Upon seeing that the material world isn't all there is, one realizes a shift in perspective is what frees them and brings the joy that comes with newfound spiritual freedom.

When negative, this path can be dangerous. It can lead to all sorts of enslavements and addictions. Those who only accept what their physical eye tells them are subject to all sorts of illusionary perspectives with a shallow understanding (6+8=12/3) of the spirituality that make such manifestations come about. With such a perspective, there's a sense of hopelessness and eternal enslavement to matter. Perhaps...the Devil is merely believing only what the physical eye tells us.
